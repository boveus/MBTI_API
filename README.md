# MBTI_API

This is my attempt to create an API using the Go programming language.  I am planning to use a sqlite3 database that will be populated from a CSV file located (here)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type/data].  The database seeding file will be a seperate binary from the API server.

Once the database is seeded, there will be a seperate program that renders various information from the database as JSON.  This is purely an exercise to familiarize myself with APIs and the Go programming language.
